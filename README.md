# Data Enrichment Agent

Welcome to the Data Enrichment project repository!

The notebook `data_enrichment_agent.ipynb` demonstrates how to enrich data by populating missing values using Tavily, the LangGraph Framework, and OpenAI. It accepts CSV, Excel files, or Google Sheets as input and generates an updated dataset with the missing data filled in.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the Data Enrichment Agent, please refer to the specific notebook.
